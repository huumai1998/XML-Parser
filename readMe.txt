Instructions:
 
1 - Open command prompt through searching "CMD" on your search bar
2 - Change directory of your file location of the Sort.jar using "cd" command
3 - Run the jar file using command:
	"java -jar Sort.jar -f[filename]"

	WHERE filename: "sample1.xml", "sample1.xml", "xmlSample.xml"
	
	Note: Not case sensitive and write the filename, sorting method, and comparing variable in any order.
			Copying and pasting from the examples of the word doc does not work as well. I've tested it and something about the "-"
			from copying and pasting is different than typing it out. **Make sure to type out the arguments**
	
	Examples: java -jar Parser.jar -fsample1.xml
